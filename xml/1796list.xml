                <p> The 1796 list is a series of names and dates that Godwin inserted into the last
                    few pages of his diary notebook for <ref target="/diary/1795-02.html">February 1795</ref>-<ref target="/diary/1796-09.html">September 1796</ref>. He compiled
                    the list – probably in <ref target="/diary/1805.html">1805</ref> – to map the growth and range of his acquaintance
                    over the years 1773-1805. In some cases the names are underlined, probably an
                    indication that the relationship was one Godwin considered particularly
                    important.</p> 
                <p>One of the pages is of particular interest (fol. 45v. below) as Godwin selects
                    twenty-five names from his main chronological list and puts them in order of
                    when he made their acquaintance. It seems probable that Godwin here lists those
                    twenty-five people he considered most significant to his life and is interested
                    in thinking about either the longevity of those relationships or how the
                    sequence of meeting matters or both. ‘Significant’ here has a deliberate (and
                    inescapable) ambiguity as the list excludes, for example, Mary Wollstonecraft.
                    Other names have then been added in the margins, which suggests that Godwin
                    revisited this list subsequently to note other important relationships. The list
                    appears after the entry for <ref target="/diary/1796-09-24.html">24 September 1796</ref>. </p>
